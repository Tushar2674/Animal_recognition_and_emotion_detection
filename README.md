# Animal_recognition_and_emotion_detection
This contains the development and evaluation of a machine learning model designed to detect animal and its emotions from the uploaded image. 

# Steps to follow
1 . Download both the model files link given below :              
    - **best_animal_detection_model**  =>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gtHkS3E1JvEGKAPXUXTIEB9jffaRdMZP/view?usp=drive_link               
    - **best_emotion_model** =>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J6vx4Rdt7BhI9IOcD3lw_Y-pEKp7eSHk/view?usp=drive_link        
2 . Download all the uploaded files .                         
3 . Download all the necessary packages mentioned in **requirements.txt** .     
4 . Run **gui.py** without debugging otherwise may result in error ( in vs code use Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging )


# Note 
1 . **Task1.ipynb** is the jupyter source file containing model creation , training and saving .        
2 . **Task1_vedio** is the demonstration vedio of the gui.py running .           
3 . **Task1_report** is uploaded which contain all the information about the model.
